# App-Code-Design

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The goal of this applicaiton was to provide users with an application that tracks their daily weight and allows them to track their progress towards their preset goal.
  To do this we needed to create a database that stores users login information and a database that tracks their weight and goals. 
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
Why were your designs successful?
  For the UI I tried to keep it simple and user friendly. The buttons and text entries were easy to use and predict. I would say my designs were successful. 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I coded my app from the bottom up. I started with the backend database and then connected it to the UI code to allow for seemless easy use. 
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I tested my code by runnning it to see if it worked. I would then try to break it by using it in intended ways and unintended ways (such as spam clicking and improper type entry)
  If it failed I used debug mode to track the issues I encountered. It helped me identify weak points in the code. 
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I had to innovate and seek outside help on the internet to find the best methods of connecting my databases to the rest of the applicaiton.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I was very proud when I got the user login UI and backend to work together effectively.
